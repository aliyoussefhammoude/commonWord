1. How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?

    answer:
    
            this test took me8 hours



2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

    answer:

            I used React and developed the frontend and tried a bit in the backend but through Firebase Storage, not .NET and SQL, because this is what we learned in school and I so love it, it is so compelling to me.

            My biggest dream is to become a fullstack developer. Therefore, from the beginning of this test I tried to use .NET from this tutorial:
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ON-Z1iD6Y-c

            But I came to one conclusion, this is a test, and I have one week, and in the test explanation it says use whatever language you wish. So I thought I'll better give my all on this week on something I studied in and have experience in. But I am so eager to learn more especially the language .NET. 
            I think I'm gonna learn it and do some projects on react and .NET. This will be my goal until summer 2022.

            I have used React to create a 3D website to my friend who just opened in Malmö Hyllie as a chiropractor. Take a look on the computer how the skeleton moves in 3D as you scroll. This is done all because of the amazing react code I learn in everyday:

3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you 
   did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.

    answer:

            I used React as a library and Firebase as a database storage. On this test I have done a LocalUpload component and a FirebaseUpload component. 

            The LocalUpload component you can upload a file locally and display it as the test says.
            The FirebaseUpload component you can upload a file directly to the Firebase Storage as it displays the content as well. But here we get blocked by the CORS-policy because of the URL we get from Firebase. So if you wanna try this component you have to allow CORS with this google chrome extension:
            https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf

            I had a problem that took time but I solved it. The problem was:
                for example:
                    if you take a text file which has exactly the same amount of the word "the" as the word "but", the word that appears first will display in between the foo-bar.

            My solution was to throw an Alert error if that happened. If I had more time I would make the user much more comfortable with the error handling. 

            Another problem that I had but that I could solve and I really wanted to solve, the problem was:
                for example:
                    if I upload a text file with actual words, my solution would display the most used word with no problem, but sometimes if you upload another file with swedish word, my solution would take letters as most used words, and I mean letter FROM a word.
            
            That was really strange and if I had more time I would really dig into this to actually solve this but for the time we had here I really couldnt solve this particular problem.

            Another thing I really would like to have more time on is the design. I love to take my time when we are talking about the design because it really have to me catchy to the customer. For me the design will never be perfect. I will always have something to add to make it look better.


4. What did you think of this recruitment test?

    answer:

            I really enjoyed it. This test was really a challenge because I have never seen anything like it. But it was fun. From the beginning I was like: "this sounds easy". But when I took the time and started I was like "hmm this is actually not so easy". 

            But I had pretty fun with this test and I'm looking forward to do more in the future!


IMPORTANT!
IN THE FILE Index.js THERE ARE 2 COMPONENTS TO USE, ONE WITH LOCAL AND ONE CONNECTED WITH FIREBASE!
CHOOSE ONE AT A TIME, DEPENDS ON WHICH ONE YOU WANNA LOOK AT AND TRY.
